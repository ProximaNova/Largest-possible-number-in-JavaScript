# Largest possible number in JavaScript
Render this HTML file to find the largest non-"Infinity" number in JavaScript. This number might vary per system; I don't know if it does or not.

Use one or more of the following to render the HTML file:
* https://htmledit.squarefree.com/
* https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_myfirst
* Mozilla Firefox
* An other web browser that is not Firefox and is therefore inferior
